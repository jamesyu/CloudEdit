== CloudEdit - A Simple Backbone.js Example by James Yu

This is just a simple Backbone.js example.

I forked just for fun and study cases.

Take a look at the tutorial here:
http://www.jamesyu.org/2011/01/27/cloudedit-a-backbone-js-tutorial-by-example/

To run, simply clone, cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml, and rake db:migrate.
